    <p>Hey Hooper,</p>
    <p>
      First off, a huge thank you for signing up and showing interest in Juke.
      We're thrilled to confirm that you've secured your spot on our waitlist!
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, while we gear up for our big launch, we have a small favor to ask. 🙏
      Help us spread the word! If you know any other hoopers, teammates, or
      friends who've faced the same struggles as you in LA, let them know about
      Juke. The more the merrier! Plus, imagine the satisfaction of being the
      one to introduce them to something game-changing. ​
    </p>

    <p>
      Stay tuned for more updates, and once again, thank you for being a part of
      this exciting journey.
    </p>

    <p>Let's elevate the game together! The Juke Team 🏀🔥</p>

    <p>
      P.S. Remember, spots are limited, so sharing is caring! Let's make LA's
      basketball scene better, one court at a time.
