    <p>Every hooper knows the struggle.</p>
    <p>
      You've got the squad together, you're pumped up to play, but when it comes
      to finding a suitable indoor court in Los Angeles, you're left scrambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular courts are overcrowded, memberships to exclusive gyms can be
      expensive, and sometimes you just need a space for a spur-of-the-moment
      game or practice session without the hassle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine showing up to your favorite court, only to find it packed with
      people. You're forced to wait, hoping for a spot, but by the time it's
      your turn, your energy and motivation have ghosted you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you've tried arranging practice sessions for your team, but finding a
      time and place that suits everyone has been nothing short of a nightmare.
